# Use Rust-generated WebAssembly to speed up your performance-sensitive JavaScript

<img src="./public/img/lin_rustjs.png"/>

???

* Corollary:
  * since we are surgically replacing performance-sensitive code paths, the
    other code paths can remain the same
  * which means that Rust+Wasm is *augmenting* your JS
  * not replacing it
* furthermore, you should be able to leverage rust-generated wasm packages from
  npm transparently
  * nothing in your workflow changes
  * you just get faster dependencies

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    fn alert(s: &str);
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet() {
    alert("Hello, World!");

extern "C" {
    fn alert(s: &str);
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet() {
    alert("Hello, World!");
}
```

???

* `use` is bringing `wasm-bindgen`'s common functionality into scope

*extern "C" {
*   fn alert(s: &str);
*}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet() {

}
```

???

* importing the `window.alert` function
* `#[wasm_bindgen]` on an `extern` block creates imports at the `.wasm` level

---

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    fn alert(s: &str);
}

*#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet() {
    alert("Hello, World!");
}
```

???

* exporting a `greet` function
  * `#[wasm_bindgen]` on a `pub` function makes it an export in the `.wasm`
    binary

---

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    fn alert(s: &str);
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet() {
*   alert("Hello, World!");
}
```

???

* calling imported `alert` function like we would any normal Rust function!

---

```js
import { greet } from "./hello_world";

greet();
```

???

* Rust-generated wasm is consumable as an ES module
* just looking at this, we can't tell if the `"./hello_world"` module is JS or
  wasm
  * this is the level of transparent, it-just-works integration we aim for

# Idiomatic vs. Fast

#### Idiomatic JavaScript

```js
function decodeVlq(input) {
  // ...
  return { result, rest };
}
```

#### Faster-but-less-idiomatic JavaScript

```js
function decodeVlq(input, out) {
  // ...
  out.result = result;
  out.rest = rest;
}
```

???

* over the years, the original JS accumulated convoluted code in the name of
  performance
* often found abstraction and idiomatic code at odds with run time performance
* this example: reuse `out` object on every call = no allocation on every call
  * in theory, JITs *could* optimize the allocation away with escape analysis,
    but we found that it was not consistently happening across all JS engines

---

# Idiomatic vs. Fast

* `return -1;` instead of `throw new Error`
* JIT's type inference not recognizing "shapes" it should have
* Custom Quick Sort implementation to allow inlining comparator function

* when making JS fast, end up writing "C" inside JS
  * but without even the abstractions C offers, such as `struct`s and naming things
  * because those abstractions are not without overhead in JS
  * imply allocations, for example
* Rust has "zero-overhead abstractions"
  * Example 1: if we tried to make a `Result` type in JS, it implies heap
    allocation
  * Example 2: a function that is generic over some type, monomorphized it is as
    if you wrote versions specialized to the generic input by hand

// ...

/**
 * Make a greeting!

}
```

???

* the generated JS also wraps the raw wasm exports and provides a nice JS
  interface to them
* it converts and wraps arguments from JS into something that wasm can
  understand
  *  some combination of `i32`/`i64`/`f32`/`f64`
* we just don't have any arguments here yet, so it doesn't do anything
* what if we wanted to write our greeting into a DOM node of the user's choice?

---

### Get a DOM node, set its `textContent`
<br/>

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
use web_sys::Node;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet2(node: &Node) {
   node.set_text_content(Some("Hello, World!"));
}
```

???

* this version of hello world is putting its greeting into some DOM node's text
  content
* no more importing common Web functions by hand
  * using `web_sys` instead

---

### Get a DOM node, set its `textContent`
<br/>

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
*use web_sys::Node;

#[wasm_bindgen]
*pub fn greet2(node: &Node) {
   node.set_text_content(Some("Hello, World!"));
}
```

???

* now we are taking a DOM node parameter

---

### Get a DOM node, set its `textContent`
<br/>

```rust

use web_sys::Node;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet2(node: &Node) {
*  node.set_text_content(Some("Hello, World!"));
}
```

???

* and setting its `textContent` to "Hello, World!"

---

### Get a DOM node, set its `textContent`
<br/>

```js
import { greet2 } from "./hello_world";

greet2(document.body);
```

???

* to call this version of the function, we need to pass a DOM node
* we don't have to do anything fancy to pass the DOM node to wasm, the generated
  JS takes care of that

???

* now we are taking ownership of DOM nodes, instead of borrowing them

  * not keeping all samples around, hogging a bunch of memory
      * mean = sum of samples / number of samples
      * can just store
        1. sum of samples and
        2. number of samples
      * and then compute mean without every sample all at the same time
  * maybe useful for an FPS counter or something like that
  * we could also compute variance, stddev, min, max, etc

---

### Exposing Rust `struct`s to JavaScript

* that's all that's needed to get an ES class that mirrors the Rust `struct`!

---

### Exposing Methods to JavaScript

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
impl StreamingStats {
    // ...
}
```

???

* let's also add a constructor and some methods

---

### Exposing Methods to JavaScript

```rust
*#[wasm_bindgen]
impl StreamingStats {
    // ...
}
```

???

* to expose methods:
  * throw `#[wasm_bindgen]` on an impl block
  * then any `pub` method inside will be exposed to JS as well
      * as a method on the generated ES class

---

### Exposing Methods to JavaScript

```rust
// ...

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl StreamingStats {
*   pub fn add(&mut self, sample: f64) {
*       self.count += 1;
*       self.sum += sample;
*   }

    pub fn mean(&self) -> f64 {
        self.sum / (self.count as f64)
    }

    // ...
}
```

???

* to add a sample:
  * increment the `self.count`
  * add the sample to the rolling sum

---

### Exposing Methods to JavaScript

```rust
// ...

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl StreamingStats {
    pub fn add(&mut self, sample: f64) {
        self.count += 1;
        self.sum += sample;
    }

*   pub fn mean(&self) -> f64 {
*       self.sum / (self.count as f64)
*   }

    // ...
}
```

???

* to get the current mean of all samples seen so far, we divide the rolling sum
  by the number of smaples seen

### Exposing a Constructor to JavaScript

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
impl StreamingStats {
    // ...

    #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
    pub fn new() -> StreamingStats {
        StreamingStats {
            count: 0,
            sum: 0.0,
        }

            count: 0,
            sum: 0.0,
        }
    }
}
```

???

* use the `constructor` attribute with `wasm-bindgen`

### Generated Bindings for `StreamingStats`

```js
import * as wasm from './hello_world_bg';

export class StreamingStats {
    constructor() {
        this.ptr = wasm.streamingstats_new();
    }
    free() {
        const ptr = this.ptr;
        this.ptr = 0;
        wasm.__wbg_streamingstats_free(ptr);
    }
*   add(arg0) {
        wasm.streamingstats_add(this.ptr, arg0);
    }
*   mean() {
        return wasm.streamingstats_mean(this.ptr);
    }
}
```

???

* each of the `pub` methods we created have a corresponding method on the ES
  class
* since we are using `f64`, the arguments don't need any special treatment
* same for the constructor

---

### Generated Bindings for `StreamingStats`

```js
import * as wasm from './hello_world_bg';

export class StreamingStats {
*   constructor() {
*       this.ptr = wasm.streamingstats_new();
*   }
    free() {
        const ptr = this.ptr;
        this.ptr = 0;
        wasm.__wbg_streamingstats_free(ptr);
    }
    add(arg0) {
        wasm.streamingstats_add(this.ptr, arg0);
    }
    mean() {
        return wasm.streamingstats_mean(this.ptr);
    }
}
```

???

* and the ES class constructor calls our `StreamingStats::new` constructor
* it saves a pointer into the wasm linear memory where the `StreamingStats`
  instance lives

### Generated Bindings for `StreamingStats`

```js
import * as wasm from './hello_world_bg';

export class StreamingStats {
    constructor() {
        this.ptr = wasm.streamingstats_new();
    }
*   free() {
*       const ptr = this.ptr;
*       this.ptr = 0;
*       wasm.__wbg_streamingstats_free(ptr);
*   }
    add(arg0) {
        wasm.streamingstats_add(this.ptr, arg0);
    }
    mean() {
        return wasm.streamingstats_mean(this.ptr);
    }
}
```

???

* there is also a `free` method
* Once we give `StreamingStats` to JS, it is JS's responsibility to manage its
  lifetime
* Rust compiler can't tell when it goes out of scope, like it normally can
* also encounter this with C and C++ compiled to wasm
* can also run into this when writing "C" in JS!

### Using `StreamingStats` from JavaScript

```js
import { StreamingStats } from "./streaming_stats";

const stats = new StreamingStats();

for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
  stats.add(Math.random());

console.log(stats.mean());

stats.free();
```

???

* let's take a look at how we use `StreamingStats` from JS

---

### Using `StreamingStats` from JavaScript

```js
*import { StreamingStats } from "./streaming_stats";

const stats = new StreamingStats();

for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
  stats.add(Math.random());

console.log(stats.mean());

stats.free();
```

???

* again, using ES modules to import the `StreamingStats` ES class

---

### Using `StreamingStats` from JavaScript

```js
import { StreamingStats } from "./streaming_stats";

*const stats = new StreamingStats();

for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
  stats.add(Math.random());

console.log(stats.mean());

stats.free();
```

???

* constructing is just like any plain JS class

---

### Using `StreamingStats` from JavaScript

```js
import { StreamingStats } from "./streaming_stats";

const stats = new StreamingStats();

for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
* stats.add(Math.random());

*console.log(stats.mean());

stats.free();
```

???

* calling the `add` or `mean` method is just liek any plain JS class as well

---

### Using `StreamingStats` from JavaScript

```js
import { StreamingStats } from "./streaming_stats";

const stats = new StreamingStats();

for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
  stats.add(Math.random());

console.log(stats.mean());

*stats.free();
```

???

* the only different thing is that you have to remember to call `free` when
  you're done with it.

## Managing Lifetimes from JavaScript
<!-- <br/> -->
<!-- #### üèó &emsp; Component lifetime hooks -->
<!-- #### ü•ë &emsp; `with` functions -->
<!-- #### ü§∏ &emsp; *Future:* GC weak refs and finalizers -->

### Component Lifetime Hooks

```js
class MyCustomElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.stats = new StreamingStats();
  }

  // ...

  disconnectedCallback() {
    this.stats.free();
  }
}
```

???

* use webcomponents and custom elements component lifetime callbacks
* similar hooks for React components
  * `componentMounted` or whatever

---

### `with` Functions

```js
function withStreamingStats(f) {
  const stats = new StreamingStats();
  try {
    f(stats);
  } finally {
    stats.free();
  }
}
```

???

* similar to Python's `with` statement
* RAII in JS
* can also have `async` function version
* execute the callback `f` and make sure that resource is properly freed at the
  end

---

### `with` Functions

```js
withStreamingStats(stats => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    stats.add(Math.random());

  console.log(stats.mean());
});
```

???

* todo
