<img src="./public/img/lin_rustjs.png"/>

???

* Corollary:
  * since we are surgically replacing performance-sensitive code paths, the
    other code paths can remain the same
  * which means that Rust+Wasm is *augmenting* your JS
  * not replacing it
* furthermore, you should be able to leverage rust-generated wasm packages from
  npm transparently
  * nothing in your workflow changes
  * you just get faster dependencies

???

* motivating example: speeding up the `source-map` library by integrating
  rust+wasm
* source maps are debug info format for the Web
  * map lines in minified JS back to the original, unminified JS

# Idiomatic vs. Fast

#### Idiomatic JavaScript

```js
function decodeVlq(input) {
  // ...
  return { result, rest };
}
```

#### Faster-but-less-idiomatic JavaScript

```js
function decodeVlq(input, out) {
  // ...
  out.result = result;
  out.rest = rest;
}
```

???

* over the years, the original JS accumulated convoluted code in the name of
  performance
* often found abstraction and idiomatic code at odds with run time performance
* this example: reuse `out` object on every call = no allocation on every call
  * in theory, JITs *could* optimize the allocation away with escape analysis,
    but we found that it was not consistently happening across all JS engines

---

# Idiomatic vs. Fast

* `return -1;` instead of `throw new Error`
* JIT's type inference not recognizing "shapes" it should have
* Custom Quick Sort implementation to allow inlining comparator function

???

* when making JS fast, end up writing "C" inside JS
  * but without even the abstractions C offers, such as `struct`s and naming things
  * because those abstractions are not without overhead in JS
  * imply allocations, for example
* Rust has "zero-overhead abstractions"
  * Example 1: if we tried to make a `Result` type in JS, it implies heap
    allocation
  * Example 2: array protocol in JS vs rust
    * inlined functions
    * no allocations
  * Example 3: a function that is generic over some type, monomorphized it is as
    if you wrote versions specialized to the generic input by hand

  * red = original, pure-JS implementation
  * blue = new hybrid implementation with rust+wasm for core, perf-sensitive

* straight port led to ~6x faster than original implementation
* further algorithmic improvements got it up to ~11x faster (not reflected in
  this graph)
* relative standard deviations fell: samples are much tighter together now
* still a JS library! just core compute-bound kernel in rust+wasm
* Ultimately:
  * still have to rely on profiling!

  * add the sample to the rolling sum

class: rust-code

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl StreamingStats {
    pub fn add(&mut self, sample: f64) {

    }

*   pub fn mean(&self) -> f64 {
*       self.sum / (self.count as f64)
*   }

    // ...
}
```

???

* to get the current mean of all samples seen so far, we divide the rolling sum
  by the number of smaples seen

---

class: rust-code

.filename[src/streaming_stats.rs]

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]

    pub fn new() -> StreamingStats {
        StreamingStats {
            count: 0,
            sum: 0.0,
        }
    }
}
```

???

* also need to let JS create instances
* to add a constructor:

---

class: rust-code

.filename[src/streaming_stats.rs]

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
impl StreamingStats {
    // ...

    #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
*   pub fn new() -> StreamingStats {
        StreamingStats {
            count: 0,
            sum: 0.0,
        }
    }
}
```

???

* static `new` function that returns `Self` type

---

class: rust-code
.filename[src/streaming_stats.rs]

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
impl StreamingStats {
    // ...

*   #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
    pub fn new() -> StreamingStats {
        StreamingStats {
            count: 0,
            sum: 0.0,
        }
    }
}
```

???

* use the `constructor` attribute with `wasm-bindgen`
* this tells `wasm-bindgen` to create a JS constructor instead of a static
  method named `new`

```

???

* each of the `pub` methods we created have a corresponding method on the ES
  class
* since we are using `f64`, the arguments don't need any special treatment
* same for the constructor

---

class: js-code

.filename[pkg/streaming_stats.js]

```js

    }
    mean() {
        return wasm.streamingstats_mean(this.ptr);
    }
}
```

???

* and the ES class constructor calls our `StreamingStats::new` constructor
* it saves a pointer into the wasm linear memory where the `StreamingStats`
  instance lives

---

class: js-code

.filename[pkg/streaming_stats.js]

```js
import * as wasm from './streaming_stats_bg';

export class StreamingStats {

*   free() {
*       const ptr = this.ptr;
*       this.ptr = 0;
*       wasm.__wbg_streamingstats_free(ptr);
*   }
    add(arg0) {

    }
    mean() {
        return wasm.streamingstats_mean(this.ptr);
    }
}
```

???

* there is also a `free` method
* Once we give `StreamingStats` to JS, it is JS's responsibility to manage its
  lifetime
* Rust compiler can't tell when it goes out of scope, like it normally can
* also encounter this with C and C++ compiled to wasm
* can also run into this when writing "C" in JS!

* similar to Python's `with` statement
* RAII in JS
* creates a resource
* invokes callback with the resource

});

???

* can use `stats` inside the callback
* but `stats` is always cleaned up once the callback returns
